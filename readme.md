## Introduction

The **FavoriteLinks** add-on is a tool for managing your favorite links in an organized and efficient way. It allows you to save, edit, and remove links in a categorized list, offering an intuitive interface with features such as adding new links, renaming titles, removing unwanted entries, and managing categories.

When you open the add-on, you have quick access to your favorite links and can open them directly in the default browser. Now, there is also support for opening links in a secondary browser, should you need more flexibility.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install the **FavoriteLinks** add-on on NVDA:

1. In NVDA, open the **Tools** menu and select the **Add-on Store**.
2. In the **Available Add-ons** tab, navigate to the **Search** field.
3. Search for "favoriteLinks". In the results, press **Enter** or **Apply**, and then choose **Install**.
4. Restart NVDA to apply the changes.

## Configuration

You have full control over where your links are saved and the browser that opens them.

1. Access the NVDA menu: `NVDA+N` > *Preferences* > *Settings*.
2. In the categories list, select **Favorite Links**.

You can choose a custom location to save the links file using the **"Select or add a directory"** button (`Alt+S`).

To set a secondary browser, which can be either an installed or a portable one:

1. Navigate with the `Tab` key to the **Browser Path** field.
2. Use the **"Select browser path"** button (`Alt+N`) to add the executable of the desired browser.

## Usage

### Accessing the Add-on

* Press `Alt+Windows+K`.
* Or access it via `NVDA+N` > *Tools* > *Favorite Links*.

### Main Interface

The main interface consists of two primary fields, which can be navigated using the `Tab` key:

1. **Category**: A selection box with existing categories.
2. **Links List**: A list that shows the links associated with the selected category.

Use the **context menu** (applications key) in either of these fields to access additional options.

### Available Actions

* **Add Category**: Creates a new category.
* **Edit Category**: Renames the selected category.
* **Remove Category**: Deletes the category and all its links.
* **Export Links**: Saves all links and categories to a `.json` file.
* **Import Links**: Loads links and categories from a `.json` file.

#### In the Links List

*** Open link **: Open the link to the browser you configured.
    > **Note**: You must configure the secondary browser beforehand in the settings.

* **Add Link**: Allows you to insert a new URL. The title will be obtained automatically, but you can enter it manually if the search fails.
* **Edit Link**: Modifies the title and URL of an existing link.
